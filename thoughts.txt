-word usage chart for each category,,,, so which words are most used per category on the given data
-average amount of words a user uses to describe a meal
-average words used by category
visuals
dataset distribution,,,numbers of each  category the data was trained off of

redo the csv file to remove duplicates

possibly can do mydf.describe which shows count, unique, top, freq, and name and then plot that info
value counts normalize = true gives you a percentage
ex. mydf['color'].value_counts(normalize=True) this would take the color column and count the values and sort by percentage descending

remember to do accuracy score
